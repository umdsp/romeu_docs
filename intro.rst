**Romeu** is a content management system (CMS) designed specifically for capturing
and presenting information about theater, including written works, live performances,
and the people involved in creating and performing theatrical productions. Romeu
is built on `Django <http://djangoproject.com>`_, a high-level Python web framework
that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Romeu is the underlying architecture of the `Cuban Theater Digital Archive <http://cubantheater.org>`_ 
(CTDA), a repository for original materials and scholarship on the history of Cuban theater
as well as a community of scholarly and artistic users. While Romeu was built specifically
for use in the CTDA, the goal is for Romeu to serve as a generic platform for all
theater-related scholarly archiving; Romeu is easily extensible and little, if any, code
is specific to the CTDA's requirements.
